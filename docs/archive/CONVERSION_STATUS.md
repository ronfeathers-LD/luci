# Next.js Conversion Status

This is a **MAJOR** migration that will transform LUCI from static HTML + dynamic JS to Next.js.

## Progress Overview

### ✅ Completed
1. Next.js installed (v16.0.5)
2. Configuration files created:
   - `next.config.js`
   - `postcss.config.js`
   - `tailwind.config.js` updated
3. Package.json scripts updated

### 🔄 In Progress
- Creating Next.js App Router structure
- Converting API routes
- Creating pages

### ⏳ Remaining
- 10 API routes to convert
- 10 pages to create
- 13 components to refactor
- Navigation system to update
- Build process to migrate

## Decision Point

This conversion will require **30-50+ file changes** and significant refactoring. 

**Would you like me to:**
1. Continue with full conversion now (will take time but complete migration)
2. Create a working example first (1 route + 1 page) then you review
3. Create a migration script to automate parts

Proceeding with option 1 (full conversion) unless you specify otherwise.
